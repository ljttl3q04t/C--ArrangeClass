## 1. Introduction
FAP server assigns timetable for FPT's students. However, Some students want to make their own timetable for their own benefit. For example, register more courses, choose the schedule as you like, change class to learn with friends, so on. Unfortunately, FAP does not support them, they have to do it manually: check the list of available classes, check class timeble, and find the right match for schedule courses. In short, assign timetable can take up to 30 minutes of your life.   
<strong style="color:red">This project appears to help them do it automatically and takes less than a minute.</strong>
